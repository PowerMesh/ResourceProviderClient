# Resource Provider Client (RPC)

## Overview
RPC allows users to contribute their GPU processing power to the Distributed GPU Sharing Platform. It automates the process of detecting and registering GPUs, receives tasks from the Central Server, processes them, and sends the results back.

## Components:

### 1. GPU Detection and Registration Module

#### Purpose:
To automatically detect the user's GPU specifications and register them with the Central Server.

#### Functionalities:

- **GPU Detection**: Detect the GPU’s specifications and status.
- **Automatic Registration**: Automatically register the GPU with the Central Server.

#### Technology considerations:
- Utilize libraries like CUDA or OpenCL for GPU detection.

### 2. Task Processing Module

#### Purpose:
To receive processing tasks, execute them using the GPU, and submit the results back to the Central Server.

#### Functionalities:

- **Task Reception**: Receive tasks assigned by the Central Server.
- **Task Execution**: Use the GPU to execute the tasks efficiently.
- **Result Submission**: Submit the results to the Central Server.

#### Technology considerations:
- Consider using a queue to manage incoming tasks efficiently.
- Implement optimization techniques to make full use of the GPU's processing power.

### 3. Resource Monitoring Module

#### Purpose:
To monitor the GPU’s usage and availability and communicate this information to the Central Server.

#### Functionalities:

- **GPU Usage Monitoring**: Continuously monitor how much of the GPU's capacity is being used.
- **Availability Reporting**: Report the GPU's availability to the Central Server. 

#### Technology considerations:
- Use monitoring tools and libraries that can provide real-time data on GPU usage.

### 4. Reward Handling Module

#### Purpose:
To manage the rewards earned by the user for contributing their GPU processing power.

#### Functionalities:

- **Earnings Tracking**: Keep track of the user’s earnings in tokens.
- **Earnings Withdrawal**: Allow users to withdraw their earnings to their blockchain wallet.

### 5. User Interface (UI)

#### Purpose:
To provide users with an intuitive interface for managing their GPU contributions.

#### Functionalities:

- **Dashboard**: Provide a dashboard showing GPU status, tasks processed, and earnings.
- **Settings**: Allow users to configure settings such as GPU usage limits.
- **Earnings**: Display the amount of tokens earned and provide options to withdraw them.

#### Technology considerations:
- The UI should be user-friendly and intuitive.
- Consider using a cross-platform GUI library.

### 6. Security Module

#### Purpose:
To ensure secure communications and protect user data.

#### Functionalities:

- **Secure Communication**: Use SSL/TLS encryption for communications with the Central Server.
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive user data stored locally.

#### Technology considerations:
- Implement proper authentication mechanisms.
- Regularly update security protocols.

## Scalability and Performance

- The RPC should be lightweight and have minimal impact on the user's system performance.
- It should be scalable to support GPUs with varying specifications.
